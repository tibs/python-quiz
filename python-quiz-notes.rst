CamPUG quiz ideas
=================

Note that I am only interested in Python 3, and at that ideally in Python 3.7.

Silly: first year you used Python. Score a point if it was prime.

  Prime years between 1990 and 2019 are:

      1993,
      1997,
      1999,
      2003,
      2011,
      2017

Silly: the only anagrams of Python appear to be:

* phyton -  (Botany) botany a unit of plant structure, usually considered as
  the smallest part of the plant that is capable of growth when detached from
  the parent plant
* typhon -  (Classical Myth & Legend) Greek myth a monster and one of the
  whirlwinds: later confused with his father Typhoeus

so that isn't much use.

Which is better: '\'something\'' or "'something'"
(and why)

Which is correct: logger.info("Found %s", something) or logger.info("Found %s" % something)
(and why)

In the late 1980s, I had to research the most commonly useful sorts of
collection, so we could implement them in a C library. From smalltalk I
got (more or less): Array, List, Set, Bag and Dictionary. What are the nearest
Python equivalents (if any). One point for each, or if there isn't a standard
answer and you say so:

Array - elements are retrieve by index

    To this purpose, Python arrays. Actually, smalltalk arrays were also
    defined as being fixed size. Anyone who said numpy arrays would also
    get a point, as it's not an unreasonable assumption that real
    N-dimensional arrays might be meant.

Dictionary - maps keys to values

    Dictionaries

Set - each element is unique

    Sets

Bag - each element is unique, but has an associated integer

    collections.Counter - one of the most overlooked classes in the standard
    library, but actually quite useful.

Linked List - each element "points to" the next element

    Single and double linked list - there is no example in the standard
    library.

What is the Python operator for exponentiation? - i.e. for typing x<something>2
to means "x squared".

What is the "@" operator used for?

    How to distinguish this from the "@" in front of decorators? Maybe call it
    the "@" infix operator, or the "@" arithmetic operator.

    a = 1     # not a tuple

    a = {}     # empty dictionary
    a = {1: 2} # dictionary
    a = {1, 2} # set

    a, *, b = 1, 2, 3, 4
    a, *    = 1, 2, 3, 4

Why do we need `self`?
----------------------

#. We need it as a method argument because it doesn't have to be called
   "self" - i.e., the programmer has to say what name to use.

   Also, if we want to be able to pass it in (so we can call a method as
   ``<class_name>.<method_name>(<instance>, ...)``) then it helps to have
   an explicit place in the argument list for it. Although this is an edge
   case, and one could argue that it doesn't of itself *require* having `self`
   explicitly mentioned in the arguments.

#. We need it in a method body to differentiate between:

   .. code:: python

      <class_name>.a = 3
      self.a = 3
      a = 3
