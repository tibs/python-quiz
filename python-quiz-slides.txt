Silly: first year you used Python. Score a point if it was prime.

Which is better: '\'something\'' or "'something'"
(and why)

Which is correct: logger.info("Found %s", something) or logger.info("Found %s" % something)
(and why)

In the late 1980s, I had to research the most commonly useful sorts of
collection, so we could implement them in a C library. From smalltalk I
got (more or less): Array, List, Set, Bag and Dictionary. What are the nearest
Python equivalents (if any). One point for each, or if there isn't a standard
answer and you say so:

Array - elements are retrieve by index

    To this purpose, Python arrays. Actually, smalltalk arrays were also
    defined as being fixed size. Anyone who said numpy arrays would also
    get a point, as it's not an unreasonable assumption that real
    N-dimensional arrays might be meant.

Dictionary - maps keys to values

    Dictionaries

Set - each element is unique

    Sets

Bag - each element is unique, but has an associated integer

    collections.Counter - one of the most overlooked classes in the standard
    library, but actually quite useful.

Linked List - each element "points to" the next element

    Single and double linked list - there is no example in the standard
    library.

What is the Python operator for exponentiation? - i.e. for typing x<something>2
to means "x squared".

What is the "@" operator used for?

    How to distinguish this from the "@" in front of decorators? Maybe call it
    the "@" infix operator, or the "@" arithmetic operator.
